# Documentation

This directory explains the design decisions behind `lopas-distributed-learning`.

The repository is intentionally layered:

```text
README.md   -> project overview and quick start
schemas/    -> machine-readable interchange contracts
src/        -> executable reference implementation
tests/      -> executable invariants
examples/   -> end-to-end learning stories
docs/       -> architecture, reasoning, and design decisions
```

## Recommended reading order

1. [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) — system boundaries and module responsibilities.
2. [`rii-local-learning.md`](rii-local-learning.md) — why RII is local and what an update candidate means.
3. [`distributed-transfer.md`](distributed-transfer.md) — how evidence crosses units without becoming authority.
4. [`eventual-resonance.md`](eventual-resonance.md) — why the network does not require global convergence.
5. [`receipts-and-lineage.md`](receipts-and-lineage.md) — auditability, portable receipts, and Git lineage.
6. [`ai-integration.md`](ai-integration.md) — how reasoning systems can attach through adapters and schemas.
7. [`design-invariants.md`](design-invariants.md) — rules that implementations must not silently violate.

## One-sentence model

> Local outcomes may produce local learning; imported outcomes may only produce local questions until locally tested.

## Status

These documents describe the current v0.1 distributed-learning core. They are design documentation for an experimental protocol, not claims of scientific validation or proof of universal transferability.
